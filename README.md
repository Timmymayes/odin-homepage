# Odin-Homepage project

This project will be my first major project for TOP. I will now
attempt to look at a layout image and set of fonts and colors, then
create a complete page from scratch using that simple reference. I'll
make some customizations to make it my own but overall I'll follow the
suggestion.

## DevLog

Since this is my first project I'll also maintain a dev-log of this
project in emacs org-mode. This should allow me to easily track my
issues and how I've overcome them. It's also a great use case for
learning org-mode.
